# We recommend keeping the actual documentation pages in
# language folders rather than in the root.
# This allows us to very easily create multilingual documentation.

# Each language directory normally has its own metadata.yaml file
# which should contain navigation for that language.
# This is so each language can easily have its own navigation.

# The navigation can have a hierarchy 3-deep. Items can have children, and those children can have children.

# For more about navigation see https://docs.ubuntu.com/documentation-builder/en/structure#navigation
